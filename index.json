If you are here, chances are that you wanted to know how is the experience of applying to a PhD in Computer Science in the USA. Many people ask me this, in fact. And here’s the thing: there’s a ton of amazing blog posts all over the internet about this. I know this because I have read a great ton of them while I was applying and they helped me a lot. For this reason, I never though about writing my own, since all the posts I have read are much better than the one I would write. However (almost) none of these cover the the point of view of Latin American applicants.\nInspired by this, here’s what I am going to do in this blog post:\nI will provide a list of the resources I read during my application process. (You can find the list at the end of this post) Some personal thoughts that might clarify how you should look at this experience if you are latino(a). What’s the game you’re playing? First, let’s put everybody in the same page here. The requisites to apply for a CS PhD program in the USA are usually 3 recommendation letters, a Statement of Purpose, your CV and transcripts. Simple, isn’t it? No, it’s not.\nThe untold story many people don’t know about is that there are at least more two prerequisites: publications and networking. And this is the “dark side of the court” that we are going to cover here.\nThe dark side of the court Publications Even though you might come from a university in which research in CS is not well developed, or you might never had the chance to write a complete research paper during your undergrad because, well… you’re just an undergrad, CS programs will almost require from you to have papers in top conferences in your field. Is this fair? Of course not. But again, this process is not about being fair, and without this information you have a huge chance of failing in your application process. Mainly because during your undergraduate research assistant opportunities you will not be so worried about publishing, and when the time comes, you’re out of the process already.\nWhat can you do to change the game? Be transparent about your objectives with your advisors. Say that you really need publications in good conferences and that this is your main goal with your current research. This puts everybody and the same page and was one of the game-changers that made me publish a short-paper at ICDM, which got me into my programs. Even though you might not be able to publish a paper in a good conference (because, let’s face it, this is hard), you can still aim for workshops and smaller venues. These won’t have the same prestige you would get with a paper in the main track of a very important conference, but still tells the following message to your prospective PI: “I am very engaged in research and I can manage to execute a research project from the beginning to the end”. Networking Besides getting good research papers, you should also aim to establish your research network starting from prospective PIs that your current advisor(s) have any kind of relationship.\nGetting a new grad student into your lab is a bet: if your advisor has a good relationship with your prospective PI, a recommendation from him will have a very different weight in comparison to recommendations from other unknown professors. This is something that makes the process more elitist and less inclusive, because it is very likely that your current advisors don’t have many of these close relationships with people from top-schools in the USA.\nWhat can you do to change the game? Talk to your advisor(s) ASAP about your plans to apply to a PhD. They can give you valuable insights about where to apply with higher chances of getting accepted. Also, they might be able to show you some hidden opportunities / contacts you did not think about at first. Establish new connections in conferences! The conferences from your field are literally the best opportunities to expand your network with PIs from universities that are in your target. The main advantage of this approach is that you can ask him/her personally about the possibility of getting new PhD students in the next application round and also about his research. Some very famous researchers got their PhD acceptance in prestigious labs through this process of starting a relationship with their PI in a conference. Take advantage of that. This one is quite polemic, but here it goes: you can send an email to your PI. The thing about contacting your PI about PhD applications is that it can be either spectacularly efficient or a complete waste of time, depending on your approach. Why do I say that? Well, basically because if you write a very ~vague/suspicious~ email with a very little care, your PI will probably ignore you. Sometimes sending an email can be useful if you want to apply to a specific university with just a few professors that spark your interest, for example. In this case, a polite and direct email asking if the PI is going to accept PhD students in the …","date":1670976000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1670976000,"objectID":"a3eb601f6b4ebdfe9da3324b92809820","permalink":"/post/applying-to-phd/","publishdate":"2022-12-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/post/applying-to-phd/","section":"post","summary":"My impressions about applying for a PhD in Computer Science in the USA / Canada as a Latino.","tags":["PhD"],"title":"Applying for a PhD as a Latino","type":"post"},{"authors":[],"categories":null,"content":" ","date":1652886000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1652886000,"objectID":"a9416b4dd0a7e88042ae5535693b5827","permalink":"/talk/datatalks-joao-pedro-mattos-portuguese/","publishdate":"2022-07-14T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/talk/datatalks-joao-pedro-mattos-portuguese/","section":"event","summary":"Mentoring session presented to Data ICMC, a ML and Data Science student group.","tags":[],"title":"DataTalks - João Pedro Mattos (Portuguese)","type":"event"},{"authors":["João Pedro Rodrigues Mattos","Ricardo Marcacini"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1657818430,"objectID":"6c61ecb5c2086ebfb35be5113028bc57","permalink":"/publication/mattos-2021-semi/","publishdate":"2022-07-14T17:07:09.788372Z","relpermalink":"/publication/mattos-2021-semi/","section":"publication","summary":"","tags":[],"title":"Semi-Supervised Graph Attention Networks for Event Representation Learning","type":"publication"},{"authors":[],"categories":[],"content":"Create slides in Markdown with Wowchemy Wowchemy | Documentation\nFeatures Efficiently write slides in Markdown 3-in-1: Create, Present, and Publish your slides Supports speaker notes Mobile friendly slides Controls Next: Right Arrow or Space Previous: Left Arrow Start: Home Finish: End Overview: Esc Speaker notes: S Fullscreen: F Zoom: Alt + Click PDF Export Code Highlighting Inline code: variable\nCode block:\nporridge = \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34; if porridge == \u0026#34;blueberry\u0026#34;: print(\u0026#34;Eating...\u0026#34;) Math In-line math: $x + y = z$\nBlock math:\n$$ f\\left( x \\right) = ;\\frac{{2\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x - 4} \\right)}}{{\\left( {x + 4} \\right)\\left( {x + 1} \\right)}} $$\nFragments Make content appear incrementally\n{{% fragment %}} One {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} **Two** {{% /fragment %}} {{% fragment %}} Three {{% /fragment %}} Press Space to play!\nOne Two Three A fragment can accept two optional parameters:\nclass: use a custom style (requires definition in custom CSS) weight: sets the order in which a fragment appears Speaker Notes Add speaker notes to your presentation\n{{% speaker_note %}} - Only the speaker can read these notes - Press `S` key to view {{% /speaker_note %}} Press the S key to view the speaker notes!\nOnly the speaker can read these notes Press S key to view Themes black: Black background, white text, blue links (default) white: White background, black text, blue links league: Gray background, white text, blue links beige: Beige background, dark text, brown links sky: Blue background, thin dark text, blue links night: Black background, thick white text, orange links serif: Cappuccino background, gray text, brown links simple: White background, black text, blue links solarized: Cream-colored background, dark green text, blue links Custom Slide Customize the slide style and background\n{{\u0026lt; slide background-image=\u0026#34;/media/boards.jpg\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide background-color=\u0026#34;#0000FF\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} {{\u0026lt; slide class=\u0026#34;my-style\u0026#34; \u0026gt;}} Custom CSS Example Let’s make headers navy colored.\nCreate assets/css/reveal_custom.css with:\n.reveal section h1, .reveal section h2, .reveal section h3 { color: navy; } Questions?
