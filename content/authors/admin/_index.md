Hello! I am JoÃ£o Pedro Mattos, a Computer Science PhD Student at Rice University. My research interests cover the intersection between Graphs and Machine Learning. I am currently advised by [Prof. Arlei Silva](https://cs.rice.edu/~al110/).

Besides Computer Science, I am fascinated by art, specifically Music, Cinema and Literature! I have also played electric guitar since I was eight years old, so if you want to jam, just reach out!
